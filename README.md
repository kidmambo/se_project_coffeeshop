# Triple No Spro Coffee

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

Triple No Spro Coffee is an interactive webpage designed to showcase a modern coffee brand with a seamless and engaging user experience.
The webpage includes:

- Functioning Buttons & Links – Smooth navigation throughout the page.

- Animations & Effects – Subtle motion elements to enhance user engagement.

- Clean UI/UX – Responsive design for an optimal viewing experience on desktop and mobile.

This project aims to create a visually appealing and fully functional coffee shop website that reflects the brand identity of Triple No Spro Coffee.

## Plan on improving the project

Add your ideas here : I'd love to add a functional mobile order page, as well as an info page about the producers and farmers from which we source our coffees.
